                             nd stand by your side through every trial and triumph. My heart belongs to you completely. <br><br>
                             There are no words to express the depth of my feelings for you. You’ve shown me what true love is, 
                             and I am endlessly grateful to have you in my life. 
                             My heart beats only for you, and every day spent with you feels like a gift. <br><br>
                             You are my heart’s greatest treasure, and my life feels complete with you in it. 
                             You’ve been my strength in hard times and my joy in the happiest moments. 
                             I commit to you, body, mind, and soul, forever and always. <br><br>
                             You’ve captivated my heart in ways I never imagined possible. 
                             The love we share is the kind that most people dream of, and I feel so lucky to call you mine.
                             I love the way you always know how to make me laugh, even on my hardest days. Your love is my light. <br><br>
                             No matter how far apart we are, my love for you remains as strong as ever.
                             I think of you all the time, and every thought of you makes me miss you even more, every day without you feels incomplete. <br><br>
                             I love you more than words can express. Distance may separate us, but nothing can separate my love for you.
                             You are my heart, my home, and my forever. I am so grateful for every moment we share.
